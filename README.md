# My-market (user-service)

My Market is a project done for our thesis, our intention was to centralize in one place all the offers from
small/medium markets which can't afford an own website. Also we took this opportunity to learn Cloud Computing using
AWS, and focus deeply in Docker and Microservices.

In this repository you will find the backend code of our user microservice. You can find the rest microservices here:

- branch-service: https://github.com/EnzoRoselli/branch-service
- offer-service: https://github.com/EnzoRoselli/offer-service
- product-service: https://github.com/EnzoRoselli/product-service

And the common library used in this microservice:

- exception-commons: https://github.com/EnzoRoselli/exception-commons

## Stack :computer:

- Java 11
- Spring Boot 2.4.2
- Maven
- Docker
- MySQL 8
- AWS X-Ray
- Swagger

## Requirements :clipboard:

- Java 11: https://www.oracle.com/ar/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html
- Spring Boot 2.4.2: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
- Maven: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
- Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- MySQL 8: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/
- GIT: https://git-scm.com/doc

## How to Use :pencil:

- Clone project
- Clone the common library and follow the instructions in their README.
- Create a local database in MySQL with the name you wish, then run the queries from schema.sql
- In application.properties you have the Environment Variables DB_URL, DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD
- Configure the Environment Variables in your IDE and then run the application.
- As default vaules you can use:
    - DB_URL = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/exampleDBName
    - DB_USERNAME = myMarketUser
    - DB_PASSWORD = 9f1e2b88-fa7f-418f-9406-799d52abb3b3
- Use Swagger to access all the endpoints : https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/EnzoRoselli/MyMarket/1.0.0

## Run it with Docker

- Create a local database in MySQL with the name you wish, then run the queries from schema.sql
- Run in a console with docker the following commands: 
```
docker pull enzoroselli/user
```
```
docker run -p 8080:8080
-e DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/exampleDBName 
-e DB_USERNAME=myMarketUser 
-e DB_PASSWORD=9f1e2b88-fa7f-418f-9406-799d52abb3b3 
enzoroselli/user
```

## Code quality with Jacoco (code coverage library)

- Every repository MUST have at least %80 of code coverage. **More code coverage == Less headache** => **true**
- It creates code coverage reports in the folder: build -> site -> jacoco -> index.html

To see if we have a good code coverage, we have to run:
```
Maven -> LifeCycle -> Verify
```

## Branching (GitFlow) :sparkler:

- Feature_MigrateToPhone: Local/remote branch for a feature. After merge it in develop, delete it.
- Develop: Stores all completed features that haven’t yet been released
- Master: Stores the finished releases
